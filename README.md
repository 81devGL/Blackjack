The card suit symbols don't exist on your keyboard, which is why I call the chr() function to create them. The integer passed to chr() is called a Unicode code point, a unique number that identifies a character according to the Unicode standard. Unicode is often misunderstood. However, Ned Betchelder's 2012 PyCon US talk "Pragmatic Unicode, or How Do I Stop the Pain?" is an excellent introduction to Unicode, and you can find it at https://youtu.be/sgHbC6udIqc/ .
